Hubert Gray was born in County Sligo, Ireland in 1937. Orphaned at a young age, he lived with his aunt until the age of 16 when he moved to the United States. This collection of stories offer a glimpse into the world of old Ireland and the memories of Hubert's life. His daughter Christine and grandson Declan created this website to share and memorialize his experiences.
