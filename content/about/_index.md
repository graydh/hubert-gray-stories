Hubert Gray was born in County Sligo in 1937. Orphaned at a young age, he lived with extended family in Ireland before emigrating to the United States as a teenager. This collection of stories offer a glimpse into the world of old Ireland and the memories of Hubert's life. His daughter Christine and grandson Declan created this website to share and memorialize his experiences.
